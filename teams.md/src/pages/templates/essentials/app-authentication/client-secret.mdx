# Client Secret Authentication

The simplest authentication mechanism is to use a Client Secret. This method is simple and akin to using a password. The downside is that, like most passwords, you will need to rotate these occasionally, and there is a risk of your secrets being leaked. This method also makes it easy to test from your personal machine for local development.

## Setup Steps

### Create Azure Bot with Single Tenant

When creating your application, you must ensure that you select `Single Tenant` for the `Type of App` when creating your Azure Bot.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="Azure CLI">

```bash
# Create a new client secret
az ad app credential reset --id $APP_ID --append
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Configure Your Application

In your application, set the `CLIENT_SECRET` environment variable (perhaps through `.env` files or wherever you set environment variables).

## Configuration

Set the following environment variables in your application:

- `CLIENT_ID`: Your Application (client) ID
- `CLIENT_SECRET`: The client secret value you created

```env
CLIENT_ID=your-client-id-here
CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret-here
```
