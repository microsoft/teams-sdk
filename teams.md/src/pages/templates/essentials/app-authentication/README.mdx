# App Authentication

Your application needs to authenticate to be able to send a message to Teams as your bot. All bots typically have 3 entities at play:

1. Your Application Service (what the SDK helps you write)
2. Your App Registration (a registration of your bot on Azure)
3. An Azure Bot instance in your tenant (the configuration of a "bot" manifestation of your application)

Authentication means your App Service needs the ability to certify that it is _allowed_ to send a message as your Azure Bot. See [Core Concepts](../../../teams/core-concepts) for more details on how to set up your resources on Azure.

## Authentication Methods

There are 3 main ways of authenticating:

1. **[Client Secret Authentication](client-secret)** - Simple password-based authentication
2. **[User Managed Identity](user-managed-identity)** - No secrets, uses Azure managed identities
3. **[Federated Identity Credentials](federated-identity-credentials)** - Assigns managed identities to App Registration

## Configuration Reference

The authentication method is determined by the environment variables you set:

| CLIENT_ID | CLIENT_SECRET | MANAGED_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID | Output |
|-|-|-|-|
| not_set | | | No-Auth |
| set | set | | SecretsAuth |
| set | not_set | | User Managed Identity Auth |
| set | not_set | set (same as CLIENT_ID) | User Managed Identity Auth * |
| set | not_set | set (diff from CLIENT_ID) | FIC (user managed identity) * |
| set | not_set | "system" | FIC (system identity) |

Choose the authentication method that best fits your deployment scenario and security requirements.
