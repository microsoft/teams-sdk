# App Authentication

Your application needs to authenticate to send messages to Teams as your bot. Authentication allows your app service to certify that it is _allowed_ to send messages as your Azure Bot.

:::info Azure Setup Required
Before configuring your application, you must first set up authentication in Azure. See the [App Authentication Setup](/teams/app-authentication) guide for instructions on creating the necessary Azure resources.

## Authentication Methods

There are 3 main ways of authenticating:

1. **Client Secret** - Simple password-based authentication using a client secret
2. **User Managed Identity** - Passwordless authentication using Azure managed identities
3. **Federated Identity Credentials** - Advanced identity federation using managed identities

## Configuration Reference

The Teams SDK automatically detects which authentication method to use based on the environment variables you set:

| CLIENT_ID | CLIENT_SECRET | MANAGED_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID | Authentication Method |
|-|-|-|-|
| not_set | | | No-Auth (local development only) |
| set | set | | Client Secret |
| set | not_set | | User Managed Identity |
| set | not_set | set (same as CLIENT_ID) | User Managed Identity |
| set | not_set | set (different from CLIENT_ID) | Federated Identity Credentials (UMI) |
| set | not_set | "system" | Federated Identity Credentials (System Identity) |

## Client Secret

The simplest authentication method using a password-like secret.

### Setup

First, complete the [Client Secret Setup](/teams/app-authentication/client-secret) in Azure Portal or Azure CLI.

### Configuration

Set the following environment variables in your application:

- `CLIENT_ID`: Your Application (client) ID
- `CLIENT_SECRET`: The client secret value you created
- `TENANT_ID`: The tenant id where your bot is registered

```env
CLIENT_ID=your-client-id-here
CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret-here
TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id
```

The SDK will automatically use Client Secret authentication when both `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` are provided.

## User Managed Identity

Passwordless authentication using Azure managed identities - no secrets to rotate or manage.

### Setup

First, complete the [User Managed Identity Setup](/teams/app-authentication/user-managed-identity) in Azure Portal or Azure CLI.

### Configuration

<LanguageInclude section="configure-application" />

## Federated Identity Credentials

Advanced identity federation allowing you to assign managed identities directly to your App Registration.

<LanguageInclude section="availability-note" />

### Setup

First, complete the [Federated Identity Credentials Setup](/teams/app-authentication/federated-identity-credentials) in Azure Portal or Azure CLI.

### Configuration

Depending on the type of managed identity you select, set the environment variables accordingly.

**For User Managed Identity:**

Set the following environment variables:
- `CLIENT_ID`: Your Application (client) ID
- `MANAGED_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID`: The Client ID for the User Managed Identity resource
- **Do not set** `CLIENT_SECRET`
- `TENANT_ID`: The tenant id where your bot is registered

```env
CLIENT_ID=your-app-client-id-here
MANAGED_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID=your-managed-identity-client-id-here
# Do not set CLIENT_SECRET
TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id
```

**For System Assigned Identity:**

Set the following environment variables:
- `CLIENT_ID`: Your Application (client) ID
- `MANAGED_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID`: `system`
- **Do not set** `CLIENT_SECRET`
- `TENANT_ID`: The tenant id where your bot is registered

```env
CLIENT_ID=your-app-client-id-here
MANAGED_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID=system
# Do not set CLIENT_SECRET
TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id
```
