# Adapters

A BotBuilder `Adapter` is similar to a Teams SDK `Plugin` in that they both provide
an abstraction for sending and receiving activities. To make migrating stress free, we have
shipped a pre-built `BotBuilderPlugin` that can accept or create a new BotBuilder Adapter instance 
and use it for processing activities in addition to handling events through the new Teams SDK `App` class.

When a message is received, both handlers execute - first the BotBuilder handler, then the Teams SDK handler. This allows you to migrate incrementally while keeping both systems operational.
