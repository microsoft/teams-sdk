# From BotBuilder

This new iteration of Teams SDK has been rebuilt from the ground up. 
To ease the migration process, we've introduced a plugin <LanguageInclude content={{"typescript": "`@microsoft/teams.botbuilder`", "csharp": "`Microsoft.Teams.Plugins.AspNetCore.BotBuilder`", "python": "for Python"}} /> 
that lets you use a BotBuilder `ActivityHandler` and `CloudAdapter` to send or receive activities through our new abstractions.

## Why a Plugin?

Using a plugin lets us take advantage of all the new features in the Teams SDK while enabling developers to easily and incrementally
migrate from legacy activity handlers to our new handlers registered on the `App` class.
