# From BotBuilder

This new iteration of Teams SDK has been rebuilt from the ground up. To ease the migration process
we have created a plugin <LanguageInclude section="plugin-name" />, which allows you to use a botbuilder `ActivityHandler`
and `adapter` to send/receive activities through our new abstractions.

## Why a Plugin?

Because by using a plugin we are able to leverage all our new features while allowing developers to easily and incrementally
migrate activity handlers from the legacy activity handlers to our new `App` class handlers.
