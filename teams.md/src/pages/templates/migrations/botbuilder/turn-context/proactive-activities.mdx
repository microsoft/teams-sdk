# Proactive Activities

The BotBuilder proactive message flow requires you to have a conversation reference stored somewhere. In Teams SDK
we expose a <LanguageInclude section="method-name" /> method almost identical to the one passed into our activity handlers that accepts a <LanguageInclude section="param-name" />,
so all you need to store is that!

<LanguageInclude section="example" />
