# Proactive Activities

The BotBuilder proactive message flow requires storing a conversation reference. 
In Teams SDK, we expose a <LanguageInclude content={{"typescript": "`send`", "csharp": "`SendAsync`", "python": "`send`"}} /> method in the `App` class, almost identical to the one 
passed into our activity handlers through our context. This method accepts a <LanguageInclude content={{"typescript": "`conversationId`", "csharp": "`conversationId`", "python": "`conversation_id`"}} />, so storing just that is enough!

<LanguageInclude section="example" />
