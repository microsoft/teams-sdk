# Proactive Activities

The BotBuilder proactive message flow requires storing a conversation reference. 
In Teams SDK, we expose a <LanguageInclude section="method-name" /> method in the `App` class, almost identical to the one 
passed into our activity handlers through our context. 
LanguageInclude section="method-name" /> method  accepts a <LanguageInclude section="param-name" />, so storing just that is enough!

<LanguageInclude section="example" />
